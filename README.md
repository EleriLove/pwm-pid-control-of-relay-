# pwm-pid-control-of-relay-
working on a script for esp32 written in arduino which controls a relay based on a thermistor. 


I will be uploading code of this later today as I just woke up, and want to take a look through the code one more time with some better comments to explain weirdness. 

other than that.... yeah this should be fun!
